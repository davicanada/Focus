# Project Overview

## Project Mission
**Focus Gestão Escolar** is a modern, comprehensive School Management System designed to streamline administrative tasks, enhance communication between stakeholders (administrators, professors, master users), and provide robust data management for educational institutions. The goal is to replace manual processes with an efficient, digital platform that handles everything from student registration to performance reporting.

## Key Features & Capabilities
- **User Management & Authentication**: Secure role-based access control (Admin, Professor, Master) using Supabase Auth. Includes access request flows and user approval systems.
- **Academic Management**: Complete handling of Classes (Turmas), Trimesters, and Enrollments.
- **Professor Tools**: Specialized interfaces for professors to manage their classes, record occurrences, and view student data.
- **Administrative Dashboard**: A powerful admin panel for managing students, teachers, reports, and system settings.
- **Occurrence Tracking**: System for recording and managing student disciplinary or behavioral occurrences.
- **Reporting**: Generation of various reports to track academic performance and institutional metrics.

## High-Level Architecture
The application is built as a monolithic web application using **Next.js** (App Router) for both frontend and API routes, leveraging server-side rendering and static generation for optimal performance.

- **Frontend**: built with React/Next.js and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. It features a responsive UI with specific layouts for different user roles (Admin, Professor, Master).
- **Backend/API**: Next.js API Routes (`app/api/*`) handle business logic, interacting with the database.
- **Database**: **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) is used for data persistence, leveraging its real-time capabilities and strong security policies (RLS).
- **Authentication**: Native Supabase Authentication integration for secure user sessions.

## Core Framework Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **UI Components**: Custom components in `components/ui`, likely based on Radix UI or similar headless libraries (inferred from `Badge`, `Button`, `Checkbox` components).
- **Database & Auth**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- **Icons**: Lucide React (inferred).

## Development Workflow Shortlist
1. **Repository**: Git-based version control (GitHub inferred).
2. **Branching**: Feature-branch workflow recommended.
3. **CI/CD**: Not explicitly seen in context overview but likely standard Vercel or GitHub Actions pipeline.

## Getting Started Checklist
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
2. **Setup**:
   - Clone the repository.
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Configure environment variables: Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and populate Supabase credentials.
3. **Run Locally**:
   - Start dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Access at `http://localhost:3000`
4. **Database**:
   - Ensure local or remote Supabase instance is running.
   - Apply migrations/schema if needed using the SQL files in root (`supabase-schema.sql`, etc).
